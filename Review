Hi Aman, 

The document is well written. Appreciate your effort and on-time delivery. 

So, now that you have a clear idea of what a full-stack developer is, I would like you to know that I am also becoming a full-stack developer. 
I can not say, I am a complete full-stack developer, but I can promise I have come a long way. 

Are you ready to begin your journey into full stack developement? 

We will be using: 

Front-End: 
1. Angular 
2. ReactJS 

Database: 
As an exercise, list down at least 5 open source databases 

Back-End: 
1. Java (mainly spring) 
2. C# 

Also, as a next exercise, Learn about HTTP, webserver and application server fundamentals, and write a similar essay on basics. 
Remember, do not copy paste what you have read, write what you have learned. 

Good luck, 
Guru
